Count how many times ConfigProvider.fromEnv() or Config.all() is called and whether results are shared. Return: "ConfigProvider.layer(ConfigProvider.fromEnv()) is called once in listenerLayer and again in createRoutes() — potentially two separate snapshots of process.env in memory." Include deduplication opportunities.
