# Testing and Type Checking

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package dirs like `packages/opencode`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (e.g., `packages/opencode`), never `tsc` directly.
